ML Credit Scoring App

A machine learning application for predicting credit default risk using the UCI Credit Card dataset.

Overview

This project uses machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to predict whether a customer will default on their next credit card payment. The best performing model (Random Forest) is deployed via a Streamlit web interface.The prediction probability determined can be used by banks for the process of 
-evaluation of new applicants 
-identify risky customers
-automate loan/credit approval processes

Project Structure

- 'app.py' - Streamlit web application for credit risk prediction
- 'pro.py' - Model training script that trains and evaluates multiple ML models
- 'UCI_Credit_Card.csv' - Dataset containing credit card customer information
- 'requirements.txt' - Python dependencies
- 'credit_default_model.pkl' - Trained Random Forest model (generated by pro.py)
- 'scaler_model.pkl' - StandardScaler for feature normalization (generated by pro.py)
- 'roc_curves.png' - ROC curve comparison of all models (generated by pro.py)

Tech Stack
Programming Language:**Python**
ML Framework:**scikit-learn**
Frontend:**Streamlit**
Data Handling:**pandas**
Model Storage:**joblib**
Visualization:**matplotlib**

Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Train the models (required before running the app):
   bash
   python pro.py

   This will:
   - Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
   - Display accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports
   - Calculate ROC-AUC scores for each model
   - Save the best model (Random Forest) and scaler as .pkl files
   - Generate ROC curve visualization

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   

Usage

-Open the web app in your browser
-Use the sidebar sliders to input customer information:
   - Credit limit
   - Demographics (gender, education, marital status, age)
   - Payment history for the past 6 months
   - Bill amounts for the past 6 months
   - Payment amounts for the past 6 months
-Click "Predict Default Risk" to get the prediction
-The app will display whether the customer is high or low risk with the probability

Model Performance
Trains three ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
Evaluates models using Accuracy, ROC-AUC Score, and Confusion Matrix
Random Forest model results:
   Accuracy: ~81%
   ROC-AUC: ~0.77
Best balance between precision and recall for credit default prediction
Includes visual ROC curves for performance comparison
